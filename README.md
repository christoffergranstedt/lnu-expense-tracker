## Expense Tracker Application

A expense tracker application for families I did in a course at Linnaeus University.
The task was to build an application in PHP without any frameworks while doing in OOP and an MVC pattern with as clean code as possible.
The auth component had a set of requirements set from the assignment.

The styling is awful, but that was not prioritized at all.
