## Expense Tracker Application

An expense-tracker-application for families I did in a course at Linnaeus University.
The task was to build an application in PHP without any frameworks while doing it in OOP and with a MVC pattern, with as clean code as possible. The application consists of two components that each is written in a MVC-pattern that together forms the application. The auth component had several requirements set from the assignment and also some boilerplate-code from the get-go which code be seen here [https://github.com/dntoll/Login_1DV608](https://github.com/dntoll/Login_1DV608).

The styling is awful, but that was not prioritized at all.
I have done some minimal adjustments recently from the original version hand in.
