## Expense Tracker Application

A expense tracker application for families I did in a course at Linnaeus University.
The task was to build an application in PHP without any frameworks while doing it in OOP and with a MVC pattern, with as clean code as possible.
The application consist of two components that each is written in a MVC-structure and than put togheter for the application. The auth component had a number of requirements set from the assignment. 

The styling is awful, but that was not prioritized at all.
